##Digital Humanities at Berkeley Summer Institute
##15-19 August 2016
##Computational Text Analysis Course

###Instructors: Laura Nelson and Teddy Roland	

##Overview
Scholars across multiple disciplines are finding themselves face-to-face with massive amounts of digitized data. In the humanities and many social science disciplines, this data is often in the form of unstructured text. This course will introduce students to cutting edge ways of structuring and analyzing digitized text-as-data, and will do so by exploring questions fundamental to the humanities. The ultimate goal is to encourage students to think about novel ways they can apply these techniques to their own data and research questions, and to provide the skills necessary to apply the methods in their own research. We will use the open source (and free!) programming language Python. We will also provide demonstration corpora.


##Prerequisites
Students must have basic computer skills, must be familiar with their computerâ€™s file system, and should be comfortable entering commands in a command line environment.
Your time in this workshop will be much more productive if you come in with some basic knowledge of Python. Students are strongly encouraged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) to learn the basic syntax of the Python programming language.

####Software Required
Please download and install [Anaconda for Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your laptops before coming to the workshop. If you have difficulties installing, please come early to class the first day for help.
